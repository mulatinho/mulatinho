Hi!

I am an old *Software Engineer* and *Systems Administrator*.
Currently I am working as SRE on an amazing company from USA.
I work with Open Source since I was a teenager and I love it. :-)

My main focus today is on:
- DevOps and SRE.
- Linux and Networking.
- Infrastructure as a Code.
- Kubernetes and Containers in general.

Fun facts:
- Nicknames: `crudo`, `mulatinho`
- I love beaches and nature.
- I love music (hear almost all day) although I am not a musician.
- I don't use my personal account to commit on companies I worked on.
