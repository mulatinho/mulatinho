## About Me  

 I started working with Linux back in my teenage years (20+ years ago), mostly coding in C and Shell, I think that gave me a strong foundation in low-level systems and scripting. With over **8 years of experience** in **DevOps**, **Site Reliability Engineering**, and **Software Engineering**, I specialize in:  

- Systems Engineering using languages like **C, Shell Script, Go, Python, Node.js, TypeScript**
- Automating deployments and infrastructure using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Kubernetes**  
- Optimizing cloud platforms, including **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **AWS**  
- Ensuring system availability and performance using **CI/CD pipelines**, monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, and advanced **troubleshooting** techniques  

I am passionate about **solving complex challenges**, improving system reliability, and contributing to **open-source projects**.
